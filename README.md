# AI---Text-to-Image

 Introducing My New Streamlit Project: AI-Powered Image Generation with Stable Diffusion!



I'm excited to share a project where I built a user-friendly web app using 

**Streamlit** and **Stable Diffusion**! This app empowers users to create stunning AI-generated images from simple text descriptions. By integrating Streamlit's seamless interface with the powerful image generation capabilities of Stable Diffusion, users can easily type in a prompt, click a button, and see their visual concepts come to life!



How It Works:

- The app is built using **Python** and leverages the `diffusers` library to load the Stable Diffusion model.



- Users enter a text description in the Streamlit app, and upon clicking "Generate Image," the model processes the prompt to produce a high-quality, AI-generated image.



- The app automatically utilizes a GPU if available, ensuring efficient performance for faster image generation.
